# Streamlining Sports Data Pipeline

## Objective
Refactor the sports data pipeline to be modular, reduce code duplication, and maintain consistent API calls and URLs.

## Steps

1. **Analyze Existing Codebase**
   - Review `sports_data.py`, `external_api_client.py`, and `bettensor_api_client.py` to identify duplicated code and common functionalities.
   - Document the different API endpoints, request parameters, and response formats used by each client.

2. **Create a Base API Client**
   - Develop a `BaseAPIClient` class that includes shared functionalities such as making HTTP requests, handling rate limiting, logging, and error handling.
   - Implement methods for GET requests with common headers and parameters.

3. **Standardize Response Handling**
   - Define a standardized method for processing API responses to extract necessary game data uniformly.
   - Implement data transformation functions that convert different API response formats into a unified internal format.

4. **Refactor External API Client**
   - Modify `external_api_client.py` to inherit from `BaseAPIClient`.
   - Use the standardized response handling methods to process data.
   - Ensure that existing API URLs and parameters remain unchanged.

5. **Refactor Bettensor API Client**
   - Modify `bettensor_api_client.py` to inherit from `BaseAPIClient`.
   - Utilize the standardized response handling methods to process data.
   - Maintain existing API URLs and parameters to avoid disrupting the input pipeline.

6. **Update SportsData Class**
   - In `sports_data.py`, replace direct usage of `APIClient` and `BettensorAPIClient` with the new modular clients.
   - Implement new methods or update existing methods to use the standardized data fetching and processing procedures.
   - Ensure that all API interactions use the base client functionalities to promote consistency.

7. **Remove Redundant Code**
   - Identify and eliminate duplicated functions and methods across the API clients.
   - Ensure that shared functionalities are handled by the `BaseAPIClient` or helper functions.

8. **Implement Configuration Management**
   - Centralize API keys, URLs, and other configuration settings to a single configuration file or environment variables.
   - Ensure that all clients access configurations consistently.

9. **Add Unit Tests**
   - Develop unit tests for `BaseAPIClient` to ensure reliable HTTP request handling.
   - Create tests for standardized response processing to verify correct data transformation.
   - Test the `SportsData` class with the refactored clients to ensure end-to-end functionality.

10. **Validate Functionality**
    - Run the existing pipeline with the refactored code to ensure that data fetching and processing work as expected.
    - Compare the results with previous outputs to verify consistency.

11. **Documentation**
    - Update documentation to reflect the new modular architecture.
    - Provide guidelines on how to add new API clients or extend existing ones using the `BaseAPIClient`.

12. **Deployment and Monitoring**
    - Deploy the refactored code to a staging environment.
    - Monitor for any issues or discrepancies in the data pipeline.
    - Roll out to production once stability is confirmed.

## Notes
- Proceed with one step at a time and verify functionality after each change.
- Keep API calls and URLs unchanged to prevent disrupting the data flow.
- Utilize version control to manage and track changes throughout the refactoring process.
